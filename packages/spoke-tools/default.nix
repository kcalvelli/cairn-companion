# companion-spoke-tools — machine-local MCP tool servers.
#
# One cargo package, multiple [[bin]] entries. Each binary is a
# short-lived stdio MCP server spawned per-call by mcp-gateway. This
# package builds all of them in one shot; the home-manager module
# picks which ones to register with mcp-gateway via the
# `services.cairn-companion.spoke.tools.<tool>.enable` toggles.
#
# Each tool's runtime dependencies (notify-send, grim, wl-clipboard,
# etc.) are added to the wrapped binary's PATH via makeWrapper so the
# tool works regardless of what PATH mcp-gateway's systemd unit
# happens to have.
